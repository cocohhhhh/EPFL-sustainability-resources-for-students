                        To confront students with the increasingly complex challenges and require them to work at the
                        frontiers of various fields, MAKE projects are interdisciplinary in nature and help to acquire
                        the
                        necessary skills. The initiative provides teachers with Discovery Learning Labs (DLLs). Spaces
                        including state-of-the-art equipment to offer practical work directly related to research or the
                        industrial environment. Finally, the initiative also provides students (bachelor and master)
                        with a
                        professional consulting service and prototyping spaces to support them in the realization of
                        their
                        open projects.

                        inaugurated in September 2018, is intended mainly for ENAC students, but is also open to BA and

                        develop
                        their own ideas and require a practical learning space.
